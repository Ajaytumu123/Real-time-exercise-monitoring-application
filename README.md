In this project, I designed an AI that uses webcam footage to accurately detect exercises in real time and counts reps. OpenCV is used to access the webcam on your machine, a pretrained CNN is implemented for real-time pose estimation, and custom deep learning models are built using TensorFlow/Keras to recognize what exercise is being performed. In addition, this project includes a guided data collection pipeline which is used to generate training data for the custom deep learning models. Using my data, the LSTM model achieved an accuracy score of 91.78% and a categorical cross-entropy loss of 1.51e-3 on the validation dataset. The attention-based Bi-LSTM achieved an accuracy score of 94.3% and a categorical cross-entropy loss of 2.08e-5 on the validation dataset. From that point, joint angles are extracted from the pose estimation coordinates and heuristics are used to track the exercise and count reps. Finally, visualization tools are included that display joint angles, rep counts, and probability distributions.
